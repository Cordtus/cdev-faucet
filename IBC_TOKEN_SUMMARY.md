# IBC Token Integration Summary

## What Was Done

### 1. Token Configuration
✓ Added OSMO and USDC IBC tokens to `tokens.json`:
- **OSMO**: `ibc/13B2C536BB057AC79D5616B8EA1B9540EC1F2170718CAFF6F0083C966FFFED0B`
  - Osmosis token from channel-2
  - Faucet amount: 1000 units (0.000001 OSMO)
  
- **USDC**: `ibc/65D0BEC6DAD96C7F5043D1E54E54B6BB5D5B3AEC3FF6CEBB75B9E059F3580EA3`
  - USD Coin from channel-1
  - Faucet amount: 1000 units (0.000001 USDC)

### 2. Scripts Created
- `register-ibc-tokens.js` - Updates token configuration
- `check-ibc-registration.js` - Checks ERC20 module status
- `register-ibc-standalone.js` - Attempts registration (requires MNEMONIC)
- `test-ibc-faucet-distribution.js` - Tests faucet distribution
- Various other registration scripts

### 3. Current Status
- ✓ IBC tokens have bank metadata
- ✓ Tokens are configured in the faucet
- ✓ Can be distributed as native tokens
- ✗ Not yet registered in ERC20 module (registration transaction succeeded but tokens remain unregistered)
- ✓ Permissionless registration is enabled
- ✓ Registration transaction submitted: `79213D3DBC638AA00B6AD59DB8EB3B353FEB7FACF1133F0535F3CD9CDD6F4D41`

## Registration Attempts

We attempted to register the IBC tokens using `MsgRegisterERC20` with empty `erc20addresses` array (for native coin registration). The transaction succeeded but the tokens weren't registered. 

This could indicate:
1. The module might require specific token denoms to be passed
2. There might be a different registration process for IBC tokens
3. Additional permissions or governance might be required
4. The chain might handle IBC token registration differently

### Alternative Approaches
1. Check if there's a specific IBC token registration process
2. Try using governance proposals if permissionless registration doesn't work for IBC tokens
3. Contact chain developers for the correct registration method

## Current Functionality
Even without ERC20 registration, the faucet can:
- ✓ Send IBC tokens to Cosmos addresses (via bank module)
- ✓ Send IBC tokens to EVM addresses (as native tokens)
- ✓ Track balances and enforce limits
- ✓ Use very small test amounts (0.000001 tokens)

## After Registration
Once registered in the ERC20 module:
- IBC tokens will have ERC20 addresses
- Can be used in EVM smart contracts
- Accessible via ERC20 precompile
- Full EVM compatibility

## Verification
Run `node scripts/check-ibc-registration.js` to check the current status.
